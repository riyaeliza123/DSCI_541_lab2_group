    "YOUR ANSWERS HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A data broker is a company or individual that collects, processes, and sells data about individuals. They gather data from various sources, such as public records, online activities, surveys etc. which is then analyzed, organized, and packaged into profiles or datasets that can be valuable targeted advertising, market research and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Direct identifiers are pieces of information that explicitly identify an individual. Indirect identifiers are pieces of information that, on their own, may not identify an individual directly, but when combined with other data or used in a certain context, they can lead to the identification of a person. Examples of direct identifiers are name, email and SSN, while indirect identifiers can be zipcode, gender, salary range and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. K-anonymity and L-diversity concepts were introduced to bring anonymity into a certain dataset that is curated, in order to protect a participant's privacy. K-anonymity requires the dataset to have atleaset K individuals that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain attributes. L-diversity is an extension of k-anonymity that addresses the limitation of k-anonymity by ensuring not only indistinguishability but also diversity in the sensitive attributes of the anonymized records.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Even though k-anonymity can help to anonymize the dataset, it does have some drawbacks. For example if the attacker has is an ex-employee of the company they attack, they have enough background information to decipher the anonymized data using their understanding of the company structure and their knowledge of the employees. Another possible attack is if a group of individuals sharing the same quasi-identifiers all have the same value for a sensitive attribute, it reduces the protection level.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The fundamental guarantee of differential privacy is that the presence or absence of any your data (an individual's data) should not significantly impact the output or analysis of the dataset. This means that the results derived should be general and not specific to the individuals, that is, the analysis must not compromise the anonymity of any individual in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \n",
    "Differential privacy works by adding carefully calibrated noise to thr analyses performed on a dataset. The goal is to ensure that the inclusion or exclusion of any individual's data does not have a significant impact on the output, making it challenging for an external observer to discern specific information about any particular individual\n",
    "7. Some additional approaches we can take to ensure data privacy are data encryption, regular audits and monitoring, data masking and endpoint security measures being employed.."

Your TA will assist in this by bringing up topics that you might not have thought of, ask questions to break the silence or a dead end, and move the conversation along so that you have time to go through most questions.

    "- Commit to learning, not \"winning\" debates. \n",
    "- Comment in order to share information and develop arguments further, not to persuade.\n",
    "- Listen respectfully, without interrupting, to try to understand each others' views.\n",
    "    - Don't focus on what you are going to say next while someone else is talking.\n",
    "- Challenge ideas, not individuals.\n",
    "    - And be open to having your own ideas challenged.\n",
    "- Think about as good arguments as possible against your position.\n",
    "    - This is especially useful if many of your peers have the same opinion, help your group find angles that you might otherwise be missing.\n",
    "- Allow everyone the chance to speak.\n",
    "    - Politely ask members of your group about their opinion.\n",
    "- Avoid assumptions about any member of the class or generalizations about social groups.\n",
    "    - Be careful about asking individuals to speak on the behalf of their (perceived) social group.\n",

    "**Answer 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When companies collect information about our online behavior then the users are mainly concerned with privacy and the potential misuse of their data. The problem further arises when the companies are not transparent with their data collection policies and don’t explicitly ask for user consent to collect their behavioral data. For example, [Samsung with its Smart TVs was recording user conversations or voice recordings without transparent consent](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/samsung-voice-recording-smart-tv-breach-privacy-law-campaigners-claim) from their living rooms back in 2015. If the above two concerns regarding privacy and consent are protected by the companies, then we think it's still an acceptable exchange and we feel it's similar to the concept of Social Contract Theory. Also, the governments can help regulate this exchange by passing stringent laws that protect the customer as done by the European Union in its GDPR regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We feel that the very basic services an online company provides, for example Facebook allowing us to use Instagram for free, should be the minimum compensation for the exchange of data. It’s similar to a barter system where anonymized user information is exchanged for using the platform. For further user’s compensation, it should depend on the company's business model whether they want to pay back the users for this information share or not. The local governments should also pass laws preventing disproportionate profit minting. More than compensation the users privacy and consent is more important and that should be protected as a non-negotiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reasonable tradeoff**: Google’s suite of services such as Gmail, Google Search, Google Maps are the services which are offered for free to users, and in exchange Google collects data to improve its search results, offer location based services etc. The value derived from these services, including efficient email management, accurate search results, and convenient navigation, is often seen as a fair exchange for the data shared by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unreasonable tradeoff**: [TikTok has been in controversy for its data collection practices](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/19/tiktok-has-been-accused-of-aggressive-data-harvesting-is-your-information-at-risk). TikTok’s data collection methods include the ability to collect user contact lists, access calendars, scan hard drives including external ones and geo locate devices on an hourly basis. While using the app it requires significantly more permissions than it needs. We feel that the value derived from the platform doesn’t justify the risks associated with the extent of data collection and privacy concerns.\n"

    "**Answer 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We think that ensuring basic privacy for everyone is important but providing additional features at a cost could help sustain free services while offering premium options to customers who value heightened privacy. Further, there is a significant market for competitors and alternatives who focus more on privacy like ProtonMail for email instead of Gmail, Signal for messaging instead of WhatsApp, and privacy-focused cloud storage services like Tresorit. Another good example of the case that the customers will pay extra if the company offers better privacy and security features is Apple. Apple phones are usually more expensive than the competitors but it has currently 60% of Smartphone market share in the United States as of 2024, which shows customers are willing to pay more for better privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cloud Storage and File Sharing services, Communication and Messaging Services, and Password Managers are among the instances where individuals may find themselves willing to invest more than in other areas. Users frequently opt for premium cloud storage services that prioritize robust security and privacy features, a vital consideration for both individuals and businesses managing sensitive or confidential data. Password managers play a crucial role in storing and encrypting sensitive login information. Many users gravitate towards paid services that provide advanced security features, including two-factor authentication and secure password sharing, to fortify their accounts against unauthorized access. On the other hand we think services like social media which are associated with freedom of speech should be freely available to all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic privacy should be a fundamental right that should be protected and available to everyone regardless of their financial means. Companies can charge on heightened security and privacy features. The right to privacy is recognized in various international human rights documents, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Treating privacy as a total commodity raises ethical concerns as it will lead to more societal inequalities and compromise the principles of fairness. For example, an uneducated small scale farmer won’t be able to protect himself and his family if that happens. Let’s say his health data is sold off to insurance companies without anonymized data protection, then the insurance companies can misuse that to charge him a higher premium leading to a more unequal society. Hence, the right to basic privacy is a fundamental right for all.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. Terms and conditions set by any company should be understandable and user friendly, so that it reaches to all age groups of people. We suggest few ways on how to improve the quality of terms of service by companies. Firstly, write the terms and conditions in a simple and short form using simple terms instead of complicated language. By doing so, it will be easy for middle and high school children to understand how the data is being is used and what are they conditions on using their services. Secondly, providing key points or highlighting them will helps users to focus on them and get a clear understanding. Additionally, we can think of, like instead of displaying all the terms and conditions at a time, revealing them in a bits will help users for better understanding the content. Lastly, using interactive elements, like instead of using text companies can use audio communication which attracts the user. Using audio infromation will not attract users but it is easier to understand. An enhancement for this can be, based on their location, the audio can be generated/translated on user's language. So by making these improvements, the terms of service can be conveyed effectively to all age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In this modern era, we are all tied up to use all digital media. Many esssential aspects like communication, information sharing, payments, entertainment are all connected with platforms like Whatsapp, Facebook, Gmail, youtube, tiktok and many more. Its difficult to opt out from these service as these are linked to our day to day activities. People are very hesitant to move to other altervative options. Although we have some alternative options like small platforms other than Facebook, whatsapp, instagram  for communication, people find it difficult to use. Its because if some people use them and others dont then it becomes difficult for communicating. If change should happen , then it should be from all. One instance happened during CoVid, Whatsapp has updated its privacy policy  which includes sharing some user data to Facebook. This change concerned so many people on how their personal data is being share and what is being shared.At that time, many people shifted to use other communication app Signal which is a privacy-focussed messaging app with end-to-end encryption. But it doesn't stood in the race for longer time, as majority of people not migrated to signal from Whatsapp.\n",

One of its biggest technical advantages over previous law enforcement tools is that they have a huge set of images including the general public, not just photos of previous convicts. <a href=\"https://openmedia.org/press/item/privacy-commissioners-find-police-use-of-clearview-ai-violated-privacy-rights-of-canadians\">A recent data breach revealed that Clearview AI is employed among American and Canadian law enforcement, including by the Vancouver Police Department</a>.\n",

    "<li>Why is the salary that is printed for the new employee so different when using differential privacy versus when we are not using it? Would you say this is a feature of differential privacy or a drawback?\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>What does it mean that there is a tradeoff between privacy and utility? Describe this in the context of differential privacy specifically referring to the figure with the same name in the notebook and comment on why the size of the data matters.</li>\n",
    "<li>Provide feedback on your general experience working through the notebook. What worked well and what do you think could be improved? Was it suitable for someone with your background level of experience with differential privacy (a brief high level introduction to the main concepts during lecture)? Did you find that seeing examples in actual code helpful for your understanding of what differential privacy is and how it can be employed in a data analysis?</li>\n",
